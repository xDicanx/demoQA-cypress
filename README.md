# **QA Automation Portfolio - Cypress Tests for qa-practice.netlify.app**

## **Description**
This repository contains automated test scripts developed with Cypress for the site [qa-practice.netlify.app](https://qa-practice.netlify.app). The tests cover essential functionalities such as login/logout, cart management, and order submission, simulating real-world scenarios for QA practice.

## **Test Scenarios**
### **1. Login and Logout**

### **2. Add to Cart**
- Adds products to the cart from the product list.
- Ensures items are displayed in the cart with correct details.

### **3. Modify Cart**
- Randomly modifies the quantity of items in the cart.
- Removes items from the cart and verifies the updated total.

### **4. Submit Order**
- Completes the order process with valid data.
- Validates the confirmation message after successful order submission.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Framework:** Cypress
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub
